# projectHaven

projectHaven will provide services to both day care owners and parents/guardians by connecting parents with the nearest secured daycare service closest to them. They get to monitor their children through an app connected to the cctv camera of the room their child/ward is kept in. This way registered day care owners get to increase their customer reach and parents are more relaxed knowing their children/wards are in safe hands.
